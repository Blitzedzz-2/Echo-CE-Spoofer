# Echo CE Spoofer

**Echo CE Spoofer** is a tool designed to spoof the window title of **Cheat Engine** processes. It allows you to bypass certain anti-cheat mechanisms by dynamically changing the process window's title, making it appear as a different application. This tool works by modifying the process ID and window title, making the target process harder to detect in games or systems that monitor process activity.

(I was in a rush making this)

## Features

- **Dynamic Window Title Spoofing**: Change the title of Cheat Engine windows with a random string, making it harder for anti-cheat systems to identify.
- **Process Detection**: Identifies Cheat Engine processes based on executable names (`cheatengine-i386.exe`, `cheatengine-x86_64.exe`, etc.).
- **Easy to Use**: Simply run the application, and it will automatically detect and spoof the title of any Cheat Engine window running on your system.

## Requirements

- **Windows OS**: The tool is designed to run on Windows-based systems.
- **Administrator Privileges**: Depending on the system and the game, you may need to run the tool as an administrator to modify certain process properties.
